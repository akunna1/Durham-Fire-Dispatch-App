Project Notes:
- NAD83 / North Carolina State Plane (US feet) EPSG:2264 needs to be reprojected to EPSG:4326 (WGS84 lat/long) because Turf.js, Leaflet, Mapbox cannot use this directly.
- Ctrl + Shift + R helps reset the browser
- Fire should not be called for Omega and Alpha incidents

VS Terminal Codes:
- npm install proj4 csv-parser fast-csv (to make scripts work)
- npm install -D ts-node @types/node (to make scripts work)
- each script has its own line of code to run too

Making the Project more Automatic?
- Rather than running the 4 scripts with npx, I want it to be done automatically before the project starts...
